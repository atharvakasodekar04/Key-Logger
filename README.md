## Features

- **Start and Stop Logging:** Users can start and stop the key logging process using dedicated buttons.
- **Real-Time Display:** Keystrokes are displayed in real-time on the web page, showing the exact keys pressed by the user.
- **Interactive Interface:** The project includes a clean and simple user interface with buttons to control the logging and a display area for the keystrokes.
- **Event Handling:** Utilizes JavaScript event listeners to capture keypress events and update the display dynamically.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** For the structure of the web page.
- **CSS:** For styling the interface.
- **JavaScript:** For capturing and displaying keystrokes in real-time.

## Project Structure

- **index.html:** The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- **style.css:** The CSS file for styling the web page.
- **index.js:** The JavaScript file containing the logic for capturing and displaying keystrokes.

## How It Works

1. **HTML:** The `index.html` file defines the layout, including the buttons to start and stop logging and the display area for keystrokes.
2. **CSS:** The `style.css` file provides the styling to make the interface clean and visually appealing.
3. **JavaScript:** The `index.js` file adds event listeners to the buttons and captures the `keypress` events, updating the display area with the logged keys.
